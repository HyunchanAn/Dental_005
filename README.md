# AlphaDent AI

AlphaDent AI is an automated dental caries detection and diagnosis assistance system based on YOLOv8 instance segmentation.

## Features

- High Precision Instance Segmentation: Detects and segments dental caries based on G.V. Black classification using YOLOv8 architecture.
- Interactive Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly web UI built with Streamlit, enabling real-time image upload and analysis.
- Advanced Visualization: Utilizes Plotly to render interactive, hoverable segmentation masks directly on the browser without occluding the original clinical photos.
- Dual Model Support: Switch seamlessly between a simplified 4-class model and a detailed 9-class diagnostic model.

## Installation & Reproducibility

### 1. Repository Clone
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/AlphaDent.git
cd AlphaDent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download Model Weights
To prevent the repository from bloating, large files such as the dataset (`data/`), model weights (`*.pt`), and output images (`*.jpg`) are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

To reproduce the project and run the inference locally, please download the required `.pt` weight files from the provided Google Drive link and place them in the `weights/` directory of the project:
- [Google Drive: AlphaDent Model Weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KnM2z4ssN3THdYu2qqrDZ1JkbAmBbeiw?usp=sharing)

## Usage

To start the Streamlit web application locally, run:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Deployment

The repository is configured for seamless deployment on Streamlit Cloud. 
Simply connect the repository to your Streamlit Cloud account to host the application online.

## Architecture & Logic

The system utilizes YOLOv8 weights (e.g., `weights/yolov8x_AlphaDent_9_classes_960px.pt`) pre-loaded into the global context for low-latency inference. 
Prediction outputs are intercepted and converted into Plotly scatter plots (polygons) overlaid on the original image, allowing dynamic interaction.

## Acknowledgements

This project builds upon the original **AlphaDent** research and dataset. We sincerely thank the original authors and contributors for providing the foundational models and data:
- **Original Repository**: [ZFTurbo/AlphaDent](https://github.com/ZFTurbo/AlphaDent)
- **Dataset**: [AlphaDent Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/alpha-dent/data)

The codebase has been refactored, packaged, and extended with an interactive Streamlit web interface, but the core YOLOv8 weights and raw dataset originate from the referenced repository.
